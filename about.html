    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I'm not an artist, a musician, or an athlete — but I’ve tried all of them. I ride bicycles on long tours, I surf when I can, and I paint because I enjoy the process.</p>

    <p>What draws me in most is understanding how things are done. Whether it’s the brushwork in a painting, the rhythm in music, or the balance on a surfboard — I enjoy it more when I understand the craft behind it.</p>

    <p>This website is a place to share some of the paintings I’ve made, not as a professional, but as someone genuinely curious. If you're like me — someone who enjoys learning by doing — I hope you find something here that speaks to you.</p>

    <p>Thanks for visiting. Feel free to explore, ask questions, or just enjoy the ride.</p>
